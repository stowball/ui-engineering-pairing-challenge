# Trump's top tweets

1. Our Country is the envy of the World.
2. The Economy is the BEST IT HAS EVER BEEN! Even much of the Fake News is giving me credit for that!
3. As most people are aware, according to the Polls, I won EVERY debate, including the three with Crooked Hillary Clinton
4. The leaders of virtually every country that I met at the G-20 congratulated me on our great economy. Many countries are having difficulties on that score.
5. Now, if you really want to fix the Crisis at the Southern Border, both humanitarian and otherwise, tell migrants not to come into our country unless they are willing to do so legally
6. So important for our Country that the very simple and basic “Are you a Citizen of the United States?” question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census.
7. We have the best economy anywhere in the world, with GREAT & UNLIMITED potential looking into the future!
8. Be careful with the threats, Iran. They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!
9. The Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election, all the way up to the day that I took office, because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President.
10. All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare. How about taking care of American Citizens first!?
11. Only a few people showed up for the so-called Impeachment rallies over the weekend. The numbers were anemic, no spirit, no hope. More importantly, No Collusion, No Obstruction!
